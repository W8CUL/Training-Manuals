# Antenna testing
By KE8TJE

- A new 40m EFHW was installed 22/11/2024 on a roof work organized by N3AMK and others.
- I wanted to test and record the performance before using them. The test setup is as follows
	- A Nano VNA calibrated prior to using
	- Antennas were connected with a `DLW filter Model L1718` before connecting to the VNA
	- Data was saved with the desktop app
