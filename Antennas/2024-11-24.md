# Antenna testing
By KE8TJE

- A new 40m EFHW was installed 22/11/2024 on a roof work organized by N3AMK and others.
- I wanted to test and record the performance before using them. The test setup is as follows
	- A Nano VNA calibrated prior to using
	- Antennas were connected with a `DLW filter Model L1718` before connecting to the VNA
	- Data was saved with the desktop app

## Test Tuning the EFHW

- Current configuration: SWE 1.69 @ 14.540 M
- Added 5 turns to the coax to act as a choke
- Added a small length: 
	- SWR 1.89 @14.120 M
	- SWr 10 M not great. out of band at ~26 M it goes to 1.0
