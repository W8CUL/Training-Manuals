## Roofday - 03.02.2025

### Observations
- 10m is fine as usual 
- To fold down the antenna it needs to be in a $240 \degree$ to make it foldable
	- there is significant play in the rotation +/- $10 \degree$ from what was reported
	- the break is engaged when power is off
		- There is an external pin on the back of the controller for the break
---
#### Measurements - KE8TJE + KC3YLF

- External room end terminated with a 50 ohm load

- New Coax Measurements in the shack: N to PL with RG-8U
- 65 ft cable

### Roof work updates - N0IAN

### Satnogs
- i joined the two satellite coax on the roof using a barrel connector, so we should be able to measure through them from the shack to determine their integrity
### EFHW
- is now taken down and poorly coiled in the shack
### Yagi Coax
- Old coax to roof level was verified to be good by connecting a 50ohm and measuring swr from the shack. (see above)
- SWR measurements directly into the antenna mirrored previous measurements from the shack (bad SWR on 20 but 15 and 10 were okay)
- Coax from roof level to the antenna remains questionable, and we would like to replace it
 - the connector looked pretty sketchy
- there is a new temporary coax from the yagi to position 3 on the antenna switcher 
### Yagi Traps
- We determined that all traps are accessible without removing the antenna.
- The traps appeared fine externally (but we do not know their internal condition)
- we took measurements of some antenna dimensions to assist in identifying the correct model
	- please add those here, image ?
