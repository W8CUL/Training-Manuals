# Post TIAD training 
## Quick tips

- Getting to know your repeaters
	- repeater book [website](https://www.repeaterbook.com/index.php/en/) and app: this will tell you about the repeaters in the area
		- this has most repeaters but do not go overboard only program the ones you are in range and using
	- What do you need to know about a repeater:
		- Output frequency: (eg. 146.760 MHz)
		- offset: +/- (eg.- 0.6 MHz)
		- PL tone or CTCSS tone: a number in Hz (eg. 103.5 Hz)
- Radio Basics
	- most radios have a VFO mode and a Memory mode
	- once you have programmed your radio you would mostly use Memory mode
	- on the go if you are adding repeaters you would do it on VFO mode
	- Read your manual and get used 
- radio etiquette:
	- use the callsign and the phonetic alphabet when you are calling out
		- `other station callsign` , this is `your call sign`
		- `73`: usually means thanks and best regards. this is often used to get out of a long conversation if you want to get out of it
