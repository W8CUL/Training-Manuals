## Individual Plan - KE8TJE

- Stage 1
	- 2000 W Honda - Refer experts 
	- Potable fiberglass pole for an extension 
	- Dead meat hauler (may be optional)
	- 2 - 100 W rated EFHWs
	- 4 - 50 ft outdoor rated coax runs and storage 
	- 10,20,80 ham sticks with mag mounts
- Stage 2 - beyond this year
	- Write a grant (next EC) - ARDC/ARRL
	- Get the propane conversion kit - some say this may not be needed
	- Battery bank 
---

- Stage 3 + (more like in 5 years/when we have money)
	- Solar (for the battery bank)
## Why implement in stages
- its unlikely(needs convincing) that we can get anything beyond $2800 from ARC
- But this is something we can ask from the members
- 2 separate generators were recommended by Carl
	- We might not need that much power
