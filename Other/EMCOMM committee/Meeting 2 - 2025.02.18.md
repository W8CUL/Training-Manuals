## Why I made this committee

- Committee's was a general way of getting non officers to get involved/help with getting involved with how we as a club do things. (historically a non officer couldn't do anything)
	- SCR Committee was a great example of that. Matt made it and he did things as a non officer
- "Emcomm planning committee" - folks had comments about the name and what it was for

- In my initial email it was summarized as **"Over the next few months I want us to come up with short and long term plans for the club as far as EMCOMM is concerned."**
- Short term > How do we spend the ~$2800 we have now
- Long term > Beyond me/us keep a general plan of what we were building up to. Not throw the next guy under the bus
- This is basically my way of saying hey guys I don't want to be solely blamed if I mess up
- Some examples in the recent past
	- Got VHF kits and had a UHF repeater in the trailer
	- bought a DR2X without VHF cans / not having a real use for it 
	- Buy a trailer and wrap it with +$1000 worth of wraps just because

## Polls - General input

- We had a bunch of ideas over the past week
- Some questions 
	1. Generator or No Generator ?
	2. Trailer or No trailer ? 
- These types of yes no questions once we have heard from both sides only way is to put it to a vote
- Once we have voted we just get behind it and work towards making that happen
