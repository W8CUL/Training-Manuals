![](res/Pasted%20image%2020250225124933.png)

- using influx DB via an internal ip. (this is the data source Grafana is using)
- if has a sign in at http://localhost:8086/signin
	- This is needed to configure new databases and the like
	- I think not having external access should be fine. but I am not 100% sure
