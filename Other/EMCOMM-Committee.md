---
### Big picture stuff

- We need to plan for the next 5-10 years for the club 
- Lets look at the current/old system
	- Generator trailer with mast (Had :( )
		- Quad band radio on the trailer - this failed  due to improper installation and planning
		- UHF repeater - failed 
	- VHF kits 
		- Antennas - I replaced them 6 months ago with Slim Jims
		- usable - organization and maintenance issue 
			- should we add number locks ?
			- Just to prevent shit from getting lost due to stuff in kits growing legs
---
### Big picture stuff (contd)

-  HF kits 
	- 891
		- organization issues
	- G90
		- Never used re packaged 
		- I think it needs a bigger box 
---
### Current Funding situation

 - Currently We have $2800 no questions asked
 - We can ask for more money(from the grants) if it is justifiable 
 - Can we (No me) write to Sponsorships 
	 - [x] There is a case manufacturer - I have the contact and every thing
	 - [x] I did ask Jack December to draft an email
	 - Ian/Aidan talked about a launch labs project for a meeting they had with Brown and Valenti. Nothings else have been shared my way. Current exec's don't know how to use email. Just verbally say things and forgets all about it
- Are there questions or comments so far ?
	- Should we ask for more money
---
## Individual proposals

- Do it in 10 mins or less: Be high level 
- Order
	- KC3VOP
	- N3AMK
	- KC3YLF
	- KE8TJE

## Individual Plan - KE8TJE

- Stage 1
	- 2000 W Honda - Refer experts
	- Potable fiberglass pole for an extension 
	- Dead meat hauler (may be optional)
	- 2 - 100 W rated EFHWs
	- 4 - 50 ft outdoor rated coax runs and storage 
	- 10,20,80 ham sticks with mag mounts
- Stage 2 - beyond this year
	- Write a grant (next EC) - ARDC/ARRL
	- Get the propane conversion kit - some say this may not be needed
	- Battery bank 
---

- Stage 3 + (more like in 5 years/when we have money)
	- Solar (for the battery bank)
## Why implement in stages
- its unlikely(needs convincing) that we can get anything beyond $2800 from ARC
- But this is something we can ask from the members
- 2 separate generators were recommended by Carl
	- We might not need that much power

---
## Update from the chair (KE8TJE)

- I talked to both the local clubs K8MCR and W8MWA about the fact that we are looking to replace the trailer and I got a lot of options
- Also WA3ZZU and N8OZY were interested in helping meet with us and go generator shopping
	- Carl shared some details about what the EMS infrastructure is like
	- Bill Shaltz: talked about cheap honda non true sine lineup giving him issues in the past
	- John (KD8VMF): commented on propane generators being the way to go
	- Randy and Carl I put in the word to get them to meet with all/some of us
